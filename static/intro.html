    <h1>Introduction <small>a chapter sample</small></h1>
    <p>
      This is study chapter sample that embeds two exercises
      in the material. The idea is that the students study the subject
      and solve exercises as they proceed in the material.
    </p>

    <h3>Multiple choice questionnaire</h3>
    <p>
      The first exercise is a form where student answers and receives
      feedback in the place.
    </p>
    <div data-exercise="1" data-exercise-quiz></div>

    <h3>A file submission exercise</h3>
    <p>
      In the second exercise, the student would receive information and
      instruction for writing a small computer program. Finally, the
      created program is submitted to this file form for grading.
    </p>
    <div data-exercise="2"></div>

    <p>
      Notice that in the last exercise the feedback is always in the
      dialog. This is good for exercises that receive much longer feedback
      than the original submission form.
